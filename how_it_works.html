<h2>How it Works</h2>
<h3>Step 0: Set up the scans</h3>
<p>
For each scan a card must be set up to trigger it.  Each video will be associated with one unique RFID tag.  Details on this can be found on the wiki.  <i>NOTE: This only has to be run once.</i>
</p>
<p>
[Insert image of a tag being scanned.]
</p>
<h3>Step 1: Set up the simulation</h3>
<p>
Insert the RFID tags corresponding to the scans needed for your simulation under the skin of the mannequin.  Alternately, if the mannequin skin does not work smaller tags can be taped to the skin of the mannequin.

<h3>Step 2: Student scan as indicated</h3>
<p>
If a student feels an EDUS scan would aid his or her diagnosis, they simply pull the machine to the bedside and place the probe over the appropriate landmark.

<h3>Step 3: Scan is displayed</h3>
<p>
The system will play the scan on screen for the student to interpret.
