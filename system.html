<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
</p>

<h3>Equipment needed</h3>
<ul>
  <li> A 125 kHz USB-based RFID scanner.  To work with the software provided it must output a string for each tag read followed by a newline.</li>
  <li> Some 125 kHz RFID tags.  We purchased both the wallet-sized cards as well as the small discs.  We found the wallet cards worked well under the mannequin skin, and the discs were useful for some obstetrical scans when attached to the mannequin with skin-coloured tape.</li>
  <li> A laptop running Ubuntu Linux.</li>
  <li> A 2 m USB cable to connect your computer to the probe.</li>
  <li> (Optional) constructing something to house the RFID scanner in.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Parts we used</h3>
<ul>
<li> Olimex RFID-MOD125 available at http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8856</li>
<li> A 6 ft USB cable again from SparkFun http://www.sparkfun.com/products/517</li>
</ul>
