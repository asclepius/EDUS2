<h2>System overview</h2>
<p>
The edus<sup>2</sup><sub>TM</sub> system combines a simple RFID reader, some RFID tags, and a laptop computer to simulate bedside ultrasound.
The <a href="https://github.com/asclepius/edus2/">software</a> is available free of charge.  Currently some set up is required, contact <a href="mailto:paul.kulyk@gmail.com?subject=edus2">Paul Kulyk</a> for assistance.  As questions arise they will be added to the <a href="https://github.com/asclepius/edus2/wiki/Installation">wiki</a>.  A turn-key solution is being worked on that will allow the user simply to boot the laptop and begin scanning.

<h3>Equipment needed</h3>
<ul>
  <li> A 125 kHz USB-based RFID scanner.  To work with the software provided it must output a string for each tag read followed by a newline.  We used an <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8856">Olimex RFID-MOD125</a></li>
  <li> Some 125 kHz RFID tags.  We purchased both the <a href="http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/28141/28141-ND/1774533">wallet-sized cards</a> as well as the <a href="http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/32397/32397-ND/2666924">small discs</a>.  We found the wallet cards worked well under the mannequin skin, and the discs were useful for some obstetrical scans when attached to the mannequin with skin-coloured tape.</li>
  <li> A laptop running Ubuntu Linux.</li>
  <li> A 2 m USB cable to connect your computer to the probe.</li>
  <li> (Optional) constructing something to house the RFID scanner in.</li>
</ul>
