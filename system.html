<h2>System overview</h2>
<p>
The edus<sup>2</sup><sub>TM</sub> system combines a simple RFID reader, some RFID tags, and a laptop computer to simulate bedside ultrasound.
The <a href="https://github.com/asclepius/edus2/">software</a> is available free of charge.  Currently some set up is required, contact <a href="mailto:paul.kulyk@gmail.com?subject=edus2">Paul Kulyk</a> for assistance.  As questions arise they will be added to the <a href="https://github.com/asclepius/edus2/wiki/Installation">wiki</a>.  A turn-key solution is being worked on that will allow the user simply to boot the laptop and begin scanning.
</p>

<h3>Equipment needed</h3>
<ul>
  <li> A 125 kHz USB-based RFID scanner.  To work with the software provided it must output a string for each tag read followed by a newline.  We used an <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8856">Olimex RFID-MOD125</a></li>
  <li> Some 125 kHz RFID tags.  We purchased both the <a href="http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/28141/28141-ND/1774533">wallet-sized cards</a> as well as the <a href="http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/32397/32397-ND/2666924">small discs</a>.  We found the wallet cards worked well under the mannequin skin, and the discs were useful for some obstetrical scans when attached to the mannequin with skin-coloured tape.</li>
  <li> A laptop running Ubuntu Linux.</li>
  <li> A 2 m USB cable to connect your computer to the probe.</li>
  <li> (Optional) constructing something to house the RFID scanner in.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The steps are outlined here for general usage of the edus<sup>2</sup><sub>TM</sub> system.  As questions arise they will be answered in the <a href="https://github.com/asclepius/edus2/wiki/Installation">wiki</a>.  <a href="#Overview">Skip to the bottom</a> for a video overview.
</p>
<h3>Step 0: Set up the scans</h3>
<p>
For each scan a card must be set up to trigger it.  Each video will be associated with one unique RFID tag.  Details on this can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/asclepius/edus2/wiki/Installation">wiki</a>.  <i>NOTE: This only has to be performed once.</i>
</p>
<h3>Step 1: Set up the simulation</h3>
<p>
Insert the RFID tags corresponding to the scans needed for your simulation under the skin of the mannequin.  Alternately, if the mannequin skin does not work smaller tags can be taped to the skin of the mannequin.

<h3>Step 2: Student scans as indicated</h3>
<p>
If a student feels an EDUS scan would aid his or her diagnosis, they simply pull the machine to the bedside and place the probe over the appropriate landmark.

For the image to be displayed they must know the appropriate landmark for the scan.

<h3>Step 3: Scan is displayed</h3>
<p>
Once the landmark is correctly located, the scan is display on screen for the student to interpret.
