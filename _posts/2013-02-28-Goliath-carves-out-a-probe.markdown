title: Goliath carves out an edus2 probe
---

I've been a member of the local hackerspace [Saskatoon TechWorks](http://sktechworks.ca) for a while, finally I started making use of the tools they have.  Here is a video of an edus2 probe being carved out of a piece of maple.  Hoping to add the electronics and polish it up this weekend.
