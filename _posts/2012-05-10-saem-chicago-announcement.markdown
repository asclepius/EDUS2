title: Check us out at SAEM in Chicago on May 12, 2012
---

Dr. Olszynski and I are taking edus2 to Chicago for SAEM.  We are presenting as part of the IEME Spotlight Session on Ultrasound this Saturday (May 12) between 12:00 and 13:00 in the Erie Room.  The schedule and blurb on us is [here](http://am2012.saem.org/Schedule/twelve) under the IEME Spotlight section.

We will be bringing an edus2 machine with us to demonstrate in addition to presenting our research and design process.
