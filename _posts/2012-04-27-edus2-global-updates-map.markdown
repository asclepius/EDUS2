We received news today that another system is near completion.  This one is Brisbane, Australia.  Cheers to Luke Wainwright and team.


It is great to hear about edus2 making it's way around the world.  Please let us know if you are building your own system and keep us posted on what it is looking like.

We have added another pin to the map.
