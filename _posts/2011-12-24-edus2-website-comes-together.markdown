The main design and basic details for the website are nearing completion.  The website is host to the basic project details and from here interested parties should be able to find links to our videos, which are all hosted on Vimeo.  A wiki with more in-depth information on all aspects of the project that is user editable.  Contact information for myself and Dr. Olszynski.
