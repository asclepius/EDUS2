title: More features, save settings
---

Now that the quick add feature is set up to greatly simplify the process of adding videos in groups is set up we decided to make things even easier.  Once your card/video pairings have been setup for any given simulation you can now save that settings file for easy access later.

Why do I want this feature?  Well the slickest thing about it is that there is no longer any need for physical card switching or scanning between runs in the sim lab.  Once the videos are set up all that needs to be done is a couple of clicks to load the previous simulation for reuse and the students can scan away.

Follow the instructions on the [January 30, 2013]({{page.previous.previous.url}}) post to upgrade and test these new features.

Here is short video overview of the new features.
