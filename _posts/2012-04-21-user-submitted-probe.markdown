One of our early adopters, Jel Coward, hacked up a pneumostat collection chamber to use as a case for the probe.  Full details of the problems encountered [here](https://github.com/asclepius/edus2/wiki/Hardware)

Affordable and looks probish, only problem is that the RFID reader antenna needs to be aligned flat with the card to get any distance out of the read.  

A couple of options come to mind:
* Cut off the heat shrink and reposition the antenna manually
* Cut off the top and fix it flat to container

Thanks to Jel for submitting his idea, will update the blog with further developments.
