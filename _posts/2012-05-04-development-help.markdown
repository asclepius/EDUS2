Do you have any skills in Python, Ubuntu packaging, or CAD?

There are several [issues](https://github.com/asclepius/edus2/issues) that need addressing.  (Matt this means you).

Alternatively, if you would like to support the project and get a FREE PROBE!  A one time donation of a [rapid-prototyping machine](http://store.makerbot.com/replicator-404.html) would be welcome.
